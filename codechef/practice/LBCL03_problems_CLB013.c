// Inserting space between outputs
// You can also have multiple outputs together in a single "printf()" function.

// For example:

// printf("%d %d", 2, 3);

// // Output:
// // 2 3
// We can have as many %d as we want. Because we added a space between two %d, the output has space between two numbers.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    // Add two %d to print two numbers
    printf("%d %d", 7, 3);
